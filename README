NAME
    File::Extension - explain file extensions

SYNOPSIS
          use File::Extension qw(extplain filter_by_meta filter_by_meta_reverse);

          my @filetypes = qw(nes pl pm gb p6);

          for my $what(@filetypes) {
            printf("%s is a %s\n", $what, extplain($what));
          }

          my $document_extensions = filter_by_meta('doc');

DESCRIPTION
    File::Extension exposes functionality for getting information on
    filetypes based solely on their file extension.

    This is useful in cases where libmagic doesn't work, i.e on empty or
    corrupted files.

    The extensions and descriptions are taken from <http://fileinfo.com>.

EXPORTS
    None by default.
